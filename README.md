# AVB Introspection

A Milan-oriented introspection tool for AVB/TSN control protocols: it decodes
**MSRP, MVRP, MAAP** and **ATDECC (ADP, AECP, ACMP)** traffic from pcap files,
reconstructs the protocol state machines (reservations, VLAN registrations,
address claims, entity lifecycles, command correlation, stream connections),
and presents events, per-packet detail, timelines and live state in a web UI.

The tool is an *observer* — it decodes and correlates traffic; generating
traffic is [TSN-GEN]'s job. See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for the
full requirements and [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for the API contract.

## Quick start

Dependencies: `g++` (C++20), `make`, `zlib`, `libsodium` (and Python 3 for
the test-data generator).

```bash
make -j                       # -> build/avb-introspectd
./build/avb-introspectd       # listens on :8342, data in ./data
```

Open http://localhost:8342 in Firefox, register an account, upload a pcap
(or open one by server path), and explore. To try it without real traffic:

```bash
python3 tools/gen_pcaps.py    # writes Milan scenarios to testdata/
# then upload testdata/milan_scenario.pcap in the UI
```

### Docker (BE-3)

```bash
docker build -t avb-introspection .
docker run -p 8342:8342 -v avb-data:/data avb-introspection
```

Uploaded pcaps, sessions and user accounts persist in the `/data` volume and
survive restarts (BE-8).

## Architecture

```
frontend/            single-page web UI (vanilla JS, Firefox-first)
backend/src/
  pcapio/            pcap + pcapng readers (Ethernet captures)
  decode/            wire-format decoders for the six protocols
  tsn_gen/           vendored TSN-GEN logic-override contract (see below)
  logic/             protocol state machines as TSN-GEN logic modules
  engine/            parallel decode -> ordered single-threaded state pass
  net/               HTTP/1.1 + RFC 6455 WebSocket server (POSIX sockets)
  auth/              accounts, Argon2id password hashes (libsodium)
  store/             on-disk persistence of pcaps + session metadata
  api/               REST endpoints, WS streaming, metrics, static serving
```

Concurrency model (CO-1..4): client connections are served by a thread pool
that grows on demand up to `--max-threads`; captures are partitioned across
CPU cores and decoded in parallel; the decoded packets are then re-ordered
by capture timestamp and fed to the state machines by a single thread —
state reconstruction is order-sensitive, so reordered packets never reach
the logic modules.

The WebSocket event stream uses binary frames, each a zlib (RFC 1950)
stream the browser inflates with `DecompressionStream("deflate")` (OQ-10:
zlib at `Z_BEST_SPEED` — lightweight, native on both ends).

## TSN-GEN integration (BE-2)

TSN-GEN's protocol *logic* layer is an override mechanism: modules subclass
`ILogicModule` (`onEncode` / `onDecode` / `nextLayer`), register with
`REGISTER_LOGIC("<service>", Class)`, and read named vars through a
`LayerContext`. This backend implements every protocol state machine as
exactly such a module (`backend/src/logic/`):

| Service | Module | State reconstructed |
|---|---|---|
| `mrp_msrp` | MsrpLogic | reservation per StreamID, SR domains |
| `mrp_mvrp` | MvrpLogic | VLAN registration per VID |
| `1722_maap` | MaapLogic | address range per claimant (probe/defend) |
| `atdecc_adp` | AdpLogic | entity lifecycle incl. valid_time expiry |
| `atdecc_aecp` | AecpLogic | in-flight commands, timeouts, entity names |
| `atdecc_acmp` | AcmpLogic | stream connection per talker/listener pair |

The three contract headers in `backend/src/tsn_gen/` are vendored unmodified
from TSN-GEN (MIT). TSN-GEN v1 ships `LayerContext::getValue/setValue` as
stubs pending its Stack serializer; `VarLayerContext` here is the working
implementation backed by the decoders' field storage, so the modules run for
real today and can be linked into TSN-GEN unchanged once its serializer
lands. `VarLayerContext::getBytes/setBytes` anticipates TSN-GEN's planned
typed accessors for fields wider than `uint64_t` (e.g. the 64-byte AEM
`entity_name`).

## Investigation sessions

Every analysis session is a self-contained folder under
`data/sessions/<id>/` holding its own copy of the capture plus `notes.md`
— markdown investigation notes seeded from a template and editable in the
UI's **Notes** tab (with preview). Deleting a library upload never breaks
an existing investigation, and notes survive restarts with the session.

## Testing

```bash
make -j test                   # unit tests incl. golden-trace runs (TV-1/2)
./scripts/integration_test.sh  # black-box REST+WS test with restart (TV-3)
python3 scripts/e2e_playwright.py   # browser E2E, headless Firefox (TV-4)
```

The browser suite needs Playwright once: `pip install playwright &&
playwright install firefox` (add `--with-deps` on Ubuntu;
on other distros the GTK3/ALSA stack must be present).

`tools/gen_pcaps.py` builds byte-exact golden scenarios per protocol
(including malformed frames — decode errors become events, never crashes,
PA-5). It stands in for TSN-GEN generated traffic; regenerate the scenarios
through TSN-GEN once its serializer lands.

## Server options

```
--port N            listen port                    (default 8342)
--data DIR          persistent data directory      (default ./data)
--frontend DIR      static frontend directory      (default ./frontend)
--max-threads N     serving thread cap (CO-1)      (default 64)
--max-upload-mb N   pcap upload limit              (default 1024)
```

Runtime metrics (NF-2: per-session packet rates, per-client bytes, CPU/RSS,
pool utilisation) are at `GET /api/metrics` and shown on the UI home screen.

## Security (SE)

Registration + login are required for every API call; passwords are stored
as Argon2id hashes (libsodium `crypto_pwhash_str`); sessions use random
64-hex bearer tokens. TLS is not terminated by the backend — put a reverse
proxy in front for deployments beyond a trusted lab network (OQ-12).

### Remote deployment

`deploy/` contains an nginx reverse-proxy setup for remote access: correct
WebSocket upgrade for `/api/ws`, 1 GiB streamed uploads, and a ready-to-
enable TLS server block.

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build   # UI on port 80
```

For bare metal, point the upstream in `deploy/nginx.conf` at
`127.0.0.1:8342` and drop it into `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.

## Notes / deviations

- **OQ-11**: built with plain Make + C++20 (CMake was proposed; Make keeps
  the toolchain minimal). GCC ≥ 12 or a comparable Clang works.
- v1 is pcap-only; live capture (BE-6) and real-time views (FE-7) are v2.
- pcapng inputs are supported alongside classic pcap (µs and ns variants).
